# Inception
It's 4AM. Here I am; sleepless, on a bed in a strangeland, on a getaway.
This is the last day. Tomorrow, I will get on a bike and travel for a grueling 7 hours in the sveltering sun and return to the monotony of every day.
Why am I here again? Oh yes, I wanted to get out of the rut, build an impeccable routine, and try to get back in the game of being amazingly productive and creative. Not much came of it, but right now, right here, I'm having an out of body experience. Yeah, the most critical night when I need to get some sleep to be the most attentive the next day, and these ideas start creeping into my head instead of nightmares. God, I'd love instead for some ghosts to pop up in front of me when I open my eyes (not that it didn't happen the same night earlier). I need to buy a domain right now, and I mean right now, before the sun rises. Yes. Let's do this.

I wanted fvrtrp.io, but that's way too expensive for what it will achieve. Okay, let's go with fvrtrp.com. Maybe it has better readability for lay people, and have a better appeal overall.
But what will go on here?

# What will happen here?
I will have to build a kickass website. This will collate all my past works, and I need to blog regularly; the design has to convey the philosophy of my work, and my approach to software. It has to reflect what I am.
And it has to be kickass.Yeah.

# The philosophy
Fever trip has always been about making sudden, sketchy, mostly dubious judgement calls and taking an initiative to follow it through. This will effectively be that. It's about the instinct to do sometning cool, maybe not really menaningful but really cool. I will try to actively blog here, documenting my endeavors in coding and engineering. Maybe along the way I will learn and reflect more as an upshot.
Cheers.
